# OceanWave
My simple wave propagation demo
This is my simple OpenGL program, that can simulate simple wave propagation

According to Master Jerry Tessendorf paper: "Simulating ocean water"

I have included the paper in this project, inside the Paper folder

For the demo:
Press 's' (no quotes mark) for source brush, 'o' for obstruction brush, wait a little for animation

Press spacebar to toggle animation on/off

Compiled with Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition

You must change the platform to x64 to include the property files (OpenGL.props)
