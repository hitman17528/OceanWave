# OceanWave
My simple wave propagation demo
This is my simple OpenGL program, that can simulate simple wave propagation
According to Master Jerry Tessendorf paper: "Simulating ocean water"
I have included the paper in this project, inside the Paper folder

For the demo:
Press 's' (no quotes mark) for source brush, 'o' for obstruction brush, wait a little for animation
Press spacebar to toggle animation on/off
